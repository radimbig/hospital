## Prerequisites

- .NET SDK (Specify version, e.g., .NET 6.0 or later)
- Node.js and npm (Specify version, e.g., Node.js 16.x or later) - If a frontend is part of this repository
- AWS CLI (If deploying to AWS)
- Docker (Optional, if using containers)

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-project-directory>
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup (kamsoft API):**
    Navigate to the backend project directory (e.g., `kamsoft`):
    ```bash
    cd kamsoft 
    dotnet restore
    ```
    *(Add any other specific backend setup steps here, e.g., installing specific tools)*

3.  **Frontend Setup (if applicable):**
    Navigate to the frontend project directory (e.g., `frontend`):
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```
    *(Add any other specific frontend setup steps here)*

## Configuration

### API

The API can be configured using Environment Variables. Create a `.env` file in the `kamsoft` directory or set system environment variables.

Key environment variables:

-   `DISABLE_REGISTRATION`: Set to `true` to disable user registration.
    ```
    DISABLE_REGISTRATION=true
    ```
-   `FRONTEND_URL`: Specifies the allowed origin for CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policy. This should be the URL of your deployed frontend application.
    ```
    FRONTEND_URL=http://hospital-frontend.s3-website.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com
    ```
-   `DB_CONNECTION_STRING`: Your database connection string. It's recommended to store this securely, for example in a `dbpasswords.env` file (which should be in your `.gitignore`) and load it into your application configuration. Example format:
    ```
    Server=your_server;Port=your_port;Database=your_database;User=your_user;Password=your_password;
    ```

### Frontend

For the frontend application, it's crucial to configure the API endpoint address based on the environment (development/production).

-   Typically, you will have configuration files like `env.debug` for development and `env.production` for production.
-   Ensure the API URL in these files points to the correct backend address. For example:
    -   In `env.debug` (or similar development config): `API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api`
    -   In `env.production` (or similar production config): `API_URL=https://your-deployed-api-domain.com/api`

## Database Setup

This project uses Entity Framework Core for database migrations. To set up or update the database schema:

1.  Ensure your connection string is correctly configured (e.g., in `appsettings.Development.json` for local development, or via environment variables for production).
2.  Navigate to the directory containing the `csproj` file of your main backend project (e.g., `kamsoft`).
3.  Run the following command to apply migrations:
    ```bash
    dotnet ef database update
    ```
    If you are running this for the first time, it will create the database and the schema. Subsequent runs will apply any pending migrations.

## Running the Application

### Backend
Navigate to the `kamsoft` directory and run:
```bash
dotnet run
```
The API will typically be available at `http://localhost:5000` or `https://localhost:5001`. Check the console output for the exact URLs.

### Frontend (if applicable)
Navigate to the `frontend` directory and run:
```bash
npm start
```
The frontend will usually be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Deployment to AWS

This project is structured to be deployable to AWS, particularly using services like AWS Lambda for the backend and S3 (with CloudFront) for the frontend.

### Backend (API as an AWS Lambda function)

1.  **Configure AWS CLI:**
    If you haven't already, configure your AWS CLI with your credentials and default region:
    ```bash
    aws configure
    ```

2.  **Install Amazon.Lambda.Tools:**
    This .NET Core Global Tool helps in deploying .NET Core Lambda functions.
    ```bash
    dotnet tool install -g Amazon.Lambda.Tools
    ```

3.  **Create a new Lambda project (example):**
    While your existing project can be adapted, this command shows how to create a new .NET Lambda project scaffold. You would typically integrate the Lambda hosting model into your existing API project (e.g., using `Amazon.Lambda.AspNetCoreServer`).
    ```bash
    dotnet new lambda.EmptyFunction --name your-lambda-function-name 
    ```
    Replace `your-lambda-function-name` with your desired function name.

4.  **Deploy your API:**
    Refer to the AWS documentation and the `Amazon.Lambda.Tools` documentation for detailed steps on packaging and deploying your existing ASP.NET Core application as a Lambda function. This often involves adding a Lambda entry point to your application and using a command like `dotnet lambda deploy-serverless`.

### Frontend (Static Site Hosting on S3)

1.  **Build your frontend for production:**
    Navigate to your `frontend` directory and run:
    ```bash
    npm run build 
    ```
    This will typically create a `build` or `dist` folder with static assets.

2.  **Upload to S3:**
    -   Create an S3 bucket.
    -   Configure the bucket for static website hosting.
    -   Upload the contents of your frontend's `build` (or `dist`) folder to the S3 bucket.
    -   Consider using AWS CloudFront for HTTPS, caching, and global distribution.
